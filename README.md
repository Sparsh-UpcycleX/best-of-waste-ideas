♻️ Project Idea: Smart Waste Sorting Bot
Name: EcoSort-Bot

💡 Concept:
A robot built almost entirely from recycled parts (old motors, scrap metal, plastic, broken gadgets) that can automatically sort waste into categories:
— Plastic
— Metal
— Paper
— Organic

🛠️ How it Works:
Input Tray: People place mixed trash on a conveyor belt (belt made from old rubber, maybe bicycle tires!).

Sensors:

IR Sensor to detect object presence.

Capacitive/Inductive Sensor to identify metal.

Color Sensor to detect plastic vs paper.

Weight Sensor for density checks.

Arduino/ESP32 Control Unit:
The brain of the bot, controlling sorting arms, and running a simple logic algorithm.

Mechanical Arm (made from E-waste):
Picks the object and drops it into the correct bin.

Solar Powered:
The whole system runs on solar panels scavenged from old garden lights, making it green and off-grid.

🌱 Why This Will Win:
✅ Real-world application (helps cities manage waste).
✅ Uses recycled materials for construction — fitting the “best of waste” theme.
✅ Promotes sustainability through automation.
✅ Eye-catching during a demo — sensors, motors, moving parts, and eco-awareness = judge magnet!
